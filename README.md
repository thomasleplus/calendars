## Calypso US

This iCalendar lists the paid holidays for Calypso in the US. The observance days for some holidays can roll forward or backward depending on weekends and adjacent holidays so they cannot easility be expressed as an iCalendar recurrence rule. As a result, the dates have been added hard coded into the calendar up to 2034 (include). The calendar will stop being accurate after that.
